// The readiness decision, with no network in it.
//
// Split from the half that talks to relays for the same reason
// `Readiness.kt` is split from `ReadinessProbe.kt`: this half is pure, so
// every state it can reach is reachable from a test, including the ones a live
// relay will almost never hand you.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing and none of them are obvious:
//
//  1. THE FIRST UNMET LINK WINS. Every link below it reports `waiting`, never
//     a second failure. A column of red crosses says four things are wrong
//     when one is, and sends the reader off to fix three that are fine.
//
//  2. THE RANKED PROBE IS NOT REDUNDANT with the link above it. Cards can be
//     present and not yet PROJECTED. Only asking the observed and anonymous
//     reads the same question catches that — and asking both is also what
//     stops an empty corpus reading as a broken lens.
//
//  3. "YOUR OWN POSTS ARE BEHIND" IS AN ASIDE, NOT A LINK. It is dropped here
//     entirely: it needed a COUNT, ranking is complete without it, and the fix
//     for it is nothing at all.
//
// A `null` fact means NOT ASKED YET and yields `checking`. It must never be
// read as a negative answer: "this relay holds none of that service's cards"
// and "we have not looked" are different sentences with different next steps.

// `toNpub` is pure bech32, so importing it here keeps this module testable
// without a network and keeps hex off the screen. `INCLUDE_SPAM` is the token
// the search relay's auth gate requires on any query that names no observer.

 * probe must be able to SEE the silent degradation to anonymous ranking, and a
 * floor would hide it by returning nothing either way.
 *
 * The anonymous side carries `include:spam` because the relay's auth gate
 * CLOSES a bare `sort:rank` outright now (measured 2026-08-30). The token
 * does not change what the probe measures: `include:spam sort:rank` is still
 * the anonymous ranking — measured the same day, its top 100 shares 0 events
 * with the plain-recency `include:spam` cut, so `sort:rank` is still doing
 * the sorting and the token only opens the door.
